Time spent:

Home page: 8hrs
Job search: 7hrs
Job details: 2hrs

Each was split up across several days,
often in ~2-4hr increments due to still working
a 40hr week and other things.
Without having to divide time up, 
I feel confident that this time would have been 
significantly reduced due to ability to work
continuously for longer durations this having
longer retained focus.

This was an enjoyable challenge. It isn't often
that I get to build things from scratch in this
manner and it served as a good testing ground 
of many of my skills.

In several areas, I chose to programatically 
build blocks of content with JavaScript and 
hard-coded data, manipulating the DOM, rather
than purely using HTML and CSS because it felt 
more efficient in accomplishing the task at hand.
The outcome is of course the same, and CSS was applied
to all elements created with JS. I believe this solution
to this project showcases a good blend of raw HTML/CSS 
skill as well as JavaScript skill. 

I hope this challenge has been completed to your satisfaction.
Regardless of the outcome, I would deeplh appreciate 
feedback, as I aim to continuously improve my skills 
and grow as a developer.

Thank you for your consideration.
